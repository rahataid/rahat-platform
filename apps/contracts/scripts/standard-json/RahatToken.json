These roles are stored in this contract and can be\n * configured by admins (`ADMIN_ROLE` members) after a delay (see {getTargetAdminDelay}).\n *\n * For each target contract, admins can configure the following without any delay:\n *\n * * The target's {AccessManaged-authority} via {updateAuthority}.\n * * Close or open a target via {setTargetClosed} keeping the permissions intact.\n * * The roles that are allowed (or disallowed) to call a given function (identified by its selector) through {setTargetFunctionRole}.\n *\n * By default every address is member of the `PUBLIC_ROLE` and every target function is restricted to the `ADMIN_ROLE` until configured otherwise.\n * Additionally, each role has the following configuration options restricted to this manager's admins:\n *\n * * A role's admin role via {setRoleAdmin} who can grant or revoke roles.\n * * A role's guardian role via {setRoleGuardian} who's allowed to cancel operations.\n * * A delay in which a role takes effect after being granted through {setGrantDelay}.\n * * A delay of any target's admin action via {setTargetAdminDelay}.\n * * A role label for discoverability purposes with {labelRole}.\n *\n * Any account can be added and removed into any number of these roles by using the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions\n * restricted to each role's admin (see {getRoleAdmin}).\n *\n * Since all the permissions of the managed system can be modified by the admins of this instance, it is expected that\n * they will be highly secured (e.g., a multisig or a well-configured DAO).\n *\n * NOTE: This contract implements a form of the {IAuthority} interface, but {canCall} has additional return data so it\n * doesn't inherit `IAuthority`.

See {ERC2771Context}.\n *\n * This forwarder operates on forward requests that include:\n *\n * * `from`: An address to operate on behalf of. It is required to be equal to the request signer.\n * * `to`: The address that should be called.\n * * `value`: The amount of native token to attach with the requested call.\n * * `gas`: The amount of gas limit that will be forwarded with the requested call.\n * * `nonce`: A unique transaction ordering identifier to avoid replayability and request invalidation.\n * * `deadline`: A timestamp after which the request is not executable anymore.\n * * `data`: Encoded `msg.data` to send with the requested call.\n *\n * Relayers are able to submit batches if they are processing a high volume of requests. With high\n * throughput, relayers may run into limitations of the chain such as limits on the number of\n * transactions in the mempool. In these cases the recommendation is to distribute the load among\n * multiple accounts.\n *\n * NOTE: Batching requests includes an optional refund for unused `msg.value` that is achieved by\n * performing a call with empty calldata. While this is within the bounds of ERC-2771 compliance,\n * if the refund receiver happens to consider the forwarder a trusted forwarder, it MUST properly\n * handle `msg.data.length == 0`. `ERC2771Context` in OpenZeppelin Contracts versions prior to 4.9.3\n * do not handle this properly.\n *\n * ==== Security Considerations\n *\n * If a relayer submits a forward request, it should be willing to pay up to 100% of the gas amount\n * specified in the request. This contract does not implement any kind of retribution for this gas,\n * and it is assumed that there is an out of band incentive for relayers to pay for execution on\n * behalf of signers. Often, the relayer is operated by a project that will consider it a user\n * acquisition cost.\n *\n * By offering to pay for gas, relayers are at risk of having that gas used by an attacker toward\n * some other purpose that is not aligned with the expected out of band incentives. If you operate a\n * relayer, consider whitelisting target contracts and function selectors. When relaying ERC-721 or\n * ERC-1155 transfers specifically, consider rejecting the use of the `data` field, since it can be\n * used to execute arbitrary code.\n */\ncontract ERC2771Forwarder is EIP712, Nonces {\n    using ECDSA for bytes32;\n\n    struct ForwardRequestData {\n        address from;\n        address to;\n        uint256 value;\n        uint256 gas;\n        uint48 deadline;\n        bytes data;\n        bytes signature;\n    }\n\n    bytes32 internal constant _FORWARD_REQUEST_TYPEHASH =\n        keccak256(\n            \"ForwardRequest(address from,address to,uint256 value,uint256 gas,uint256 nonce,uint48 deadline,bytes data)\"\n        );\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Emitted when a `ForwardRequest` is executed.\n     *\n     * NOTE: An unsuccessful forward request could be due to an invalid signature, an expired deadline,\n     * or simply a revert in the requested call.
